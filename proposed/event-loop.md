# Event Loop Interface

This document describes a common interface for event based libraries.

The main goal is to allow libraries and components from different vendors to operate using a common event loop.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
